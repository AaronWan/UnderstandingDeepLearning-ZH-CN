AI is poised to change society for better or worse. These technologies have enormous potential for social good (Taddeo & Floridi, 2018; Tomašev et al., 2020), including im- portant roles in healthcare (Rajpurkar et al., 2022) and the fight against climate change (Rolnick et al., 2023). However, they also have the potential for misuse and unintended harm. This has led to the emergence of the field of AI ethics.

The modern era of deep learning started in 2012 with AlexNet, but sustained interest in AI ethics did not follow immediately. Indeed, a workshop on fairness in machine learning was rejected from NeurIPS 2013 for want of material. It wasn’t until 2016 that AI Ethics had its “AlexNet” moment, with ProPublica’s exposé on bias in the COMPAS recidivism-prediction model (Angwin et al., 2016) and Cathy O’Neil’s book Weapons of Math Destruction (O’Neil, 2016). Interest has swelled ever since; submissions to the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) have increased nearly ten-fold in the five years since its inception in 2018.

In parallel, many organizations have proposed policy recommendations for responsible AI. Jobin et al. (2019) found 84 documents containing AI ethics principles, with 88% released since 2016. This proliferation of non-legislative policy agreements, which depend on voluntary, non-binding cooperation, calls into question their eﬀicacy (McNamara et al., 2018; Hagendorff, 2020; LaCroix & Mohseni, 2022). In short, AI Ethics is in its infancy, and ethical considerations are often reactive rather than proactive.

This chapter considers potential harms arising from the design and use of AI systems. These include algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, data privacy violations, militariza- tion, fraud, and environmental concerns. The aim is not to provide advice on being more ethical. Instead, the goal is to express ideas and start conversations in key areas that have received attention in philosophy, political science, and the broader social sciences.
